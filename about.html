            <h3>Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                I achieved a score of 4 on the AP Computer Science Principles exam and earned a certificate through Meta using Coursera. This achievement demonstrates my understanding of computer science principles, programming, and problem-solving skills. I am proud to have accomplished this milestone through my dedication and hard work. This achievement will serve as a solid foundation for my future pursuits in the field of computer science, whether it be pursuing a career in this area or continuing my education in this field

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy spending my free time pursuing my hobbies of coding and video games. As someone who is passionate about technology, coding is a natural fit for me. I love the challenge of problem-solving and the satisfaction that comes with creating something from scratch. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games. I find that they provide a great escape from everyday life and offer an opportunity to unwind and relax. Moreover, video games are another medium through which I can exercise my creativity and critical thinking skills. These hobbies not only provide an enjoyable pastime but also help me develop my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.

            <h3>Post-Secondary Plan</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to attend the University of California (UC) Berkeley for higher education. Some of the other schools I have been looking into are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Duke University, Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), UC Santa Cruz, and UC Irvine. All of these universities allow me to have a great path towards my current career goal, a software developer or engineer, and also allow me to pursue my second education path, chemistry, alongside my computer science degree. During my education, I plan on getting a job, preferably a tech internship, using this money I will pay my tuition and other expenses I may have. After college I plan on getting a tech job, hopefully at one of the big tech companies, but I may also be interested in working for a chemical company as chemistry is my second biggest interest.
