                I selected my "12 Angry Men‚Äù literary analysis because I believe that it shows my understanding of how literature has an important role to play in teaching people about the complexities of the human experience. Through works of literature, we can gain insights into the ways that biases, prejudices, and fallacies can impact our perceptions and decisions. "12 Angry Men" is a powerful example of this, as it explores the dangers of allowing personal biases to influence judgments in matters of justice. By analyzing the play in depth, I hoped to gain a deeper understanding of these issues and to learn how we can work to overcome our own biases in order to make more objective and fair decisions. Overall, I believe that works of literature like "12 Angry Men" have an important role to play in educating people about the world around us and in helping us to become more thoughtful and compassionate individuals.
