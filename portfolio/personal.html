                While taking chemistry in my sophomore year of high school, I discovered that some of the concepts could be automated through code, that is also when I learned that the calculator I was using comes with Python. So, wanting to improve my coding skills and get a greater understanding of the problems we were learning in class, I decided to create a couple programs that would help me better comprehend the chemistry concepts and sharpen my coding abilities. The first, and most important program I created was a molar mass calculator. In chemistry, the concept of molar mass is the mass of a chemical measured with one mole (602 sextillion things) of molecules, and so this program would parse the input into its own separate elements and calculate the molar mass. This program then allowed me to create the next program, a stoichiometry calculator. Stoichiometry is the concept of switching between quantities of substances, for example switching between grams and moles of a substance, or switching between moles of two substances in a chemical reaction. Many stoichiometry problems require the molar mass in order to switch between grams and moles so I had to use the molar mass calculator as a base for the stoichiometry calculator. This sample of work shows off my ability to integrate concepts I am learning into my programming knowledge and create useful programs that help people. Overall, these programs were instrumental in helping me deepen my understanding of chemistry concepts and apply my programming skills in a meaningful way.

                In my pursuit of improving my programming skills and knowledge, I decided to start learning C++. Since C++ is such a low level language, it is a much different experience than the other languages I had learned before, such as JavaScript and Python. I figured learning C++ would be a great exercise and vastly increase my understanding of programming due to its low-level nature. Some of the projects I completed in my learning were creating a few programs that solved problems on the Project Euler website, which is an archive of math  problems intended for people to solve. Another project is working through the problems on the 2022 Advent of Code website, which is a set of problems meant to challenge programmers to solve and grow a better understanding of programming concepts. Additionally, C++ is widely used in industries such as gaming, finance, and software development, so I knew that having a strong foundation in C++ would be valuable for my future career prospects. Learning C++ creates a strong foundation in programming and, due to its very large usage in the technology sphere, will more than likely prepare you for careers in the technology industry. Overall, learning C++ is an incredible learning experience and I would suggest it to any beginner programmer that is looking for more of a challenge.
