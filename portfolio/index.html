                In the personal programming projects section of my website, you'll find an assortment of programs I wrote in Python that have a chemistry-based focus. These programs showcase my interest in both programming and chemistry, and demonstrate my ability to apply programming concepts to solve scientific problems. Additionally, I share my journey through learning C++, from my initial struggles to my eventual understanding and success with the language. I hope these projects demonstrate my passion for programming and problem-solving, and give you a better sense of my programming abilities and creative thinking skills.
